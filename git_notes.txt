Git Notes SDAL DSPG 2017

Connect local folder to Github using personal access token:
git remote set-url origin https://PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN@github.com/arnsbarger/REPO-NAME.git

git config —list (check your account settings)
mkdir new_directory (create git repository from scratch)
git init (initialize git repository)
 **don’t have to initialize any subfolders
git status (what’s going on in this project?)
	* shows new uncommitted files in red
	* shows files in staging area in green
git add <file> (adds file to staging area)
git add . (whatever folder you’re in, this command adds your current folder and all of its subfolders automatically)
git commit (commits everything in staging area; opens up nano window to write commit message)
git commit -m “insert 1 line commit message without opening text editor”
git diff (if you forget what changes you made, git will show you the differences between version 1 and version 2)
git log (shows history of commits, including unique commit id’s and commit message)
git log —oneline (shorthand version of git log, doesn’t include commit id’s)
git checkout <file> (if you decide you don’t like a change that was made and you haven’t committed yet, use this to return to previous version)
git checkout <unique version number> <file>
git remote -v (shows where you’re pushing and pulling to/from)


* I zoned out during the .gitignore part of the lecture.

REMOTE: Any folder that you have not initialized on git (could be elsewhere on your computer, GitHub, etc.)
* ‘push’ things to a remote
* ‘pull’ things from a remote
* git remote add origin git@github.com:maddieka/2017sdal_dspg.git (makes the repository we created on github the origin for our work)

Fork someone else’s repository…
- press “fork”
- git clone https://github.com/maddieka/other_repository.git
	- cloning automatically changes the origin for you
- make necessary change/create new file/whatever
- add and commit
- git push origin master

if the person whose repository you forked updates their repository (how dan added all students’ pid.md files to is original repository)…
- git remote add upstream <https link from original repository you’re trying to pull down>
- git pull upstream master
