Bash tutorial 5/22/2017 SDAL DSPG:

ls (list)
cd (change directory)
ls -a (list invisible files also)
cd .. (move up to parent folder)
ls -alh (shows contents of folder, permissions/size/etc of each object)
	drwxr-xr-x
	- first digit = d (directory) or l (file)
	- first group of 3 digits = what you can do
	- second group of 3 digits = what group can do
	- third group of 3 digits = what others can do
	- r = can read file
	- w = write file
	- x = execute file
mkdir folder_name (creates folder called folder_name)
pwd (print working directory)
touch title.txt (creates .txt file called title.txt)
touch subfoldername/new_textfile_name.txt
cat title.txt (prints head of the actual text content of title.txt)
more title.txt (prints entire text content, press q to quit)
rm title.txt (deletes title.txt)
rm -rf <file> (force rm)
mv title.txt new_desired_directory (move title.txt to folder called new_desired_directory)
history (prints entire history of commands)
cp title.txt title2.txt(duplicate title.txt and call new file title2.txt)
nano title.txt (open title.txt in nano to edit the text)
exit (exit RStudio server)

RScript <file> (run file from command line)
nohup Rscript <file> (keep running file, even if I log out)
nohup Rscript <file> & (keep running file, even if I log out AND run it in the background!)

To save:
- "WriteOut" = "Save"
- "^" = control key, not shift key...

FOR IPUMS SAMPLES:
mv mv usa_0000* ~/... (move multiple samples to the correct directory at once)
gunzip usa_0000#.csv (unzip csv.gz files 1000x faster than Finder)
